# Website wireframe #

***It is a visual guide that shows the frame or structural form of any website, and determines the page design or the way the contents are organized, including interface elements, browsing systems, and how to integrate them; Usually, the frame has no typographical style, color, or graphics, as the focus is on effectiveness, behavior, and priority of content. That is, the focus is on "the function of the screen, not its appearance."
The page layout focuses on the type of information displayed, the range of available jobs, the relative priorities of information and jobs, the rules used to display specific types of information, and the design of communications.
The network framework links the basic conceptual structure or information architecture to the site interface or the visual design of the site, and the network framework helps in determining the performance of the various screen templates on the site and the relationships between them. The process of designing this framework is an iterative and effective process in making rapid prototypes of the pages and at the same time evaluating The extent of the practicality in the design concept. Usually, the frameworks generation process begins between "high-end structural works such as flowcharts or site maps and screen design."
And when designing websites,ideas become tangible when designing the web frameworks for those sites. Apart from websites, web frameworks are used to make prototypes for websites for mobile devices, computer applications, or other screen-based products that include human-computer interaction. The technologies and media that will emerge in the future will give the network framework the ability to adapt and evolve.***
